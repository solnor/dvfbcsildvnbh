Move some stuff from the elevator/config file to some other global config file 

Issue now is connecting a node to the elevator data properly! 
A new node for "this" node is created in the peers.go file - should be moved
OnNewNode should be fixed


Need to:
Connect assigner
Make distributor - send until ack and all that!
Make a backup that can take over control when main node stops functioning!
Make some way of deleting orders, somehow remove orders from the entire system!

Successfully output of ID and Floorstate from receiver.
Control of 2 different nodes

ISSUES/BUGS:
- Setting obstruction to active while elevator is on a floor with door closed doesn't turn on obstruction light (which is good), 
  but the light turns on after a new request is received (which is bad)





// Cab calls do not light up buttons
Peers does not remove dead connections, always sets nodes to available
